# AI Image Upscaling Tool – Requirements

## Project Overview
A privacy-focused, offline image upscaling web app that uses advanced AI techniques (CNN/GAN via RealESRGAN). It supports batch drag-and-drop uploads, multi-scale upscaling (2x to 8x), and real-time comparison with performance metrics. Designed for small businesses, creatives, and researchers needing fast, high-quality enhancement.

## Functional Requirements

### Image Input
- Users can upload image files (PNG, JPG, JPEG, WEBP).
- Drag-and-drop support with file size validation (≤10MB).
- Display selected file name and size in UI.

### Upscaling
- Upscaling options: 2×, 4×, 6× (4×→2×), and 8× (4×→4×).
- GPU-accelerated processing if available; fallback to CPU.
- Process image and display result with a comparison slider.

### Output
- Display side-by-side comparison (original vs. upscaled).
- Show image resolution, model type, time taken, and technique.
- Download final upscaled image.

### UX Features
- Dark mode toggle with system preference and localStorage support.
- Research/help modals with ESC-to-close and outside click handling.
- Visual feedback (toasts/notifications for success, errors).
- Responsive layout for all screen sizes.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- Usability: Clean, minimal interface with informative tooltips.
- Performance: Under 10s processing time on GPU; <30s on CPU.
- Privacy: Local-only processing, GDPR-compliant file cleanup.
- Reliability: Fail-safe on model errors or unsupported formats.
- Scalability: Modular architecture for future features.
- Accessibility: Keyboard-friendly interaction and contrast modes.

## Technical Requirements

- **Backend**:
  - Python 3.8+
  - Flask (API server)
  - PyTorch, RealESRGAN, RRDBNet (AI model)
  - PIL, NumPy

- **Frontend**:
  - HTML, CSS (with dark/light themes)
  - JavaScript (vanilla)
  - Dynamic dropdowns and comparison sliders

- **Storage**:
  - Local-only (uploads/outputs)
  - Automatic deletion after 60 mins

- **Deployment Environment**:
  - Works offline (no internet dependency)
  - Runs on Windows 11 (16GB RAM, Ryzen 5 7535HS, GPU-enabled)

## Future Features

- Real-time preview with slider overlay
- Model selection (SRGAN, SwinIR)
- Image filters or auto-enhancement
- Mobile app support (Flutter or React Native)
- Multi-language interface
